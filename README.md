This branch is for the purpose of demo

Creating Process:

1. create gh-pages branch on github

2. use terminal to switch branch:
`$ git checkout gh-pages`

3. after switching gh-pages, restructure the file content in the source path
> simply place index.html in the root folder

4. execute the following statement to commit onto remote branch(gh-pages)

4-1. `$ git add .`

4-2. `$ git commit -m "Create new branch infrastructure for demo page"`

> maybe you probably need to use `$ git remote set-url origin YOURProjectAddress.git`

4-3. `$ git push origin gh-pages`

In the end, you can access this web page by:
> https://username.github.io/ProjectName/
